Multivariate Time series classification for stress detection: A case study in near real-time stress detection
Abstract—Stress is a commonly observed problem within the
healthcare industry. Identifying stress levels in real time can
help prevent negative outcomes like burnout among nurses.
Researchers are exploring the potential of using machine learning

for stress detection among nurses in hospitals. They used phys-
iological data like heart rate and respiration to predict stress

levels. However, finding this sort of solution is a challenging and
complicated issue. This is a big data problem, thus sophisticated

approaches are needed to make sure the data is correctly gath-
ered, transported, and analyzed. Multiple sensors must provide

data for stress detection, and the data must be acquired in a
brief period of time. Some of the learning models that are used
to forecast stress need a lot of computation. In this project, we
tried evaluating multiple machine learning and deep learning
models for predicting stress. We also tried to identify suitable
preprocessing strategies based on models. The best model trained
was able to identify stress using Heart rate and respiratory
rate with an accuracy of 59 percent and an F1 score of 0.57.
Despite the unexceptional findings, we are certain that some of
the processes and models will be useful if we get access to more
sensor data, such as the EDA and skin temperature sensor, which
are essential for stress prediction.
